# machine_learning_survival_of_titanic_passengers

This machine learning project entails a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic survival data using RapidMiner, focusing on predicting passenger survival rates through machine learning techniques. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, such as kMeans clustering, decision trees, and outlier detection methods (LOF and distances), the study aims to dissect how various factors—age, sex, cabin number, and location on the ship—influence survival outcomes. Following the CRISP-DM methodology, this machine learning endeavor will undergo stages of data understanding, preparation, and modeling to ensure accurate analysis and predictions. The outcome will not only illuminate survival patterns but also demonstrate the impactful application of machine learning techniques in historical data analysis
